# Notes

## Rationale

My goal for this repository is to document my learning journey as I tackle new
ideas, concepts, technologies and programming languages. My hope in keeping
this journal is that I will have to properly comprehend what I'm learning in a
way that I can clearly and concisely share it with other people, irrespective
of their knowledge background.
