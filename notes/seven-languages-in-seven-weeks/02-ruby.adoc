# Seven Languages in Seven Weeks

## Chapter 2. Ruby

Bruce likens programming languages to different characters.

"Like any person, each language took on a distinct personality. Java was like having a rich lawyer as a brother. He was fun when he was younger, but now he's a black hole that sucks away all the joy in a 100-mile radius."

Meet Ruby: "She's sometimes quirky, always beautiful, a little mysterious, and absolutely magical. Think Mary Poppins, the British nanny."

"Matz, Ruby's creator, doesn't worry about the efficiency of the language. He optimizes the efficiency of the _programmers_."

### 2.1 Quick History

Ruby was created in 1993 by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz). Ruby is:

* interpreted
** Ruby code is executed by an interpreter rather than a compiler
* dynamically typed
** types are bound at execution time rather than compile time
** trade off = flexibility vs execution safety
* object-oriented
** supports encapsulation (data and behaviour are packaged together)
** inheritance through classes (object types are  organised in class trees)
** polymorphism (objects can take many forms)
* from a family of so-called scripting languages

Ruby became popular around 2006 with the emergence of the Rails framework.

Ruby's strength is programmers productivity as opposed to execution speed.
