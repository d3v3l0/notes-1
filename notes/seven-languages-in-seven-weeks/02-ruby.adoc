# Seven Languages in Seven Weeks

## Chapter 2. Ruby

Bruce likens programming languages to different characters.

"Like any person, each language took on a distinct personality. Java was like having a rich lawyer as a brother. He was fun when he was younger, but now he's a black hole that sucks away all the joy in a 100-mile radius."

Meet Ruby: "She's sometimes quirky, always beautiful, a little mysterious, and absolutely magical. Think Mary Poppins, the British nanny."

"Matz, Ruby's creator, doesn't worry about the efficiency of the language. He optimizes the efficiency of the _programmers_."

### 2.1 Quick History

Ruby was created in 1993 by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz). Ruby is:

* interpreted
** Ruby code is executed by an interpreter rather than a compiler
* dynamically typed
** types are bound at execution time rather than compile time
** trade off = flexibility vs execution safety
* object-oriented
** supports encapsulation (data and behaviour are packaged together)
** inheritance through classes (object types are  organised in class trees)
** polymorphism (objects can take many forms)
* from a family of so-called scripting languages

Ruby became popular around 2006 with the emergence of the Rails framework.

Ruby's strength is programmers productivity as opposed to execution speed.

### 2.2 Day 1: Finding a Nanny

#### Lightning Tour

Installation:

Arch Linux:

```
yay -S ruby
yay -S ruby-irb
```

Otherwise, go to https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads and follow steps for specific platform.

#### Using Ruby with the Console

NOTE: Type `irb` to start the interactive console.

Ruby has two types of strings. Single quotes are interpreted literally. Double quotes are evaluated.

```
>> language = 'Ruby'
=> "Ruby"
>> puts 'Hello, #{language}'
Hello, #{language}
=> nil
>> puts "Hello, #{language}"
Hello, Ruby
=> nil
```

#### The Programming Model

NOTE: Ruby is a pure object-oriented language.

"Just about everything in Ruby is an object, down to each individual number."

```
>> 4
=> 4
>> 4.class
=> Integer
>> 4 + 4
=> 8
>> 4.methods
=> [:-@, :**, :<=>, :upto, :<<, :<=, :>=, :==, :chr, :===, :>>, :[], :%, :&, :inspect, :*, :+, :ord, :-, :/, :size, :succ, :<, :>, :to_int, :coerce, :to_s, :to_i, :to_f, :divmod, :to_r, :fdiv, :modulo, :remainder, :abs, :magnitude, :integer?, :floor, :ceil, :round, :truncate, :^, :odd?, :even?, :allbits?, :anybits?, :nobits?, :downto, :times, :pred, :pow, :bit_length, :digits, :numerator, :denominator, :rationalize, :gcd, :lcm, :gcdlcm, :next, :div, :|, :~, :imag, :abs2, :+@, :phase, :to_c, :polar, :angle, :conjugate, :conj, :eql?, :singleton_method_added, :i, :real?, :zero?, :nonzero?, :finite?, :infinite?, :step, :positive?, :negative?, :clone, :dup, :arg, :quo, :rectangular, :rect, :real, :imaginary, :between?, :clamp, :instance_variable_defined?, :remove_instance_variable, :instance_of?, :kind_of?, :is_a?, :tap, :instance_variable_set, :protected_methods, :instance_variables, :instance_variable_get, :private_methods, :public_methods, :public_send, :method, :public_method, :singleton_method, :define_singleton_method, :extend, :to_enum, :enum_for, :=~, :!~, :respond_to?, :freeze, :object_id, :send, :display, :nil?, :hash, :class, :singleton_class, :itself, :yield_self, :then, :taint, :tainted?, :untaint, :untrust, :untrusted?, :trust, :frozen?, :methods, :singleton_methods, :equal?, :!, :instance_exec, :!=, :instance_eval, :__id__, :__send__]
```

NOTE: "You can call any method on an object with the dot operator."

```
>> 4.odd?
=> false
>> 4.even?
=> true
>> 4.nonzero?
=> 4
>> 0.nonzero?
=> nil
```

#### Decisions

"[T]he way a language makes decisions is a central concept that shapes the way you code, and think, in a given language. Ruby is like most object-oriented and procedural languages in many ways."

```
>> x = 4
=> 4
>> x < 5
=> true
>> x <= 4
=> true
>> x > 4
=> false
>> false.class
=> FalseClass
>> true.class
=> TrueClass
```

`true` and `false` are also first-class objects.

```
>> puts 'This appears to be false.' unless x == 4
=> nil
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if x == 4
This appears to be true.
=> nil
>> if x == 4
>>   puts 'This appears to be true.'
>> end
This appears to be true.
=> nil
>> unless x == 4
>>   puts 'This appears to be false.'
>> else
>>   puts 'This appears to be true.'
>> end
This appears to be true.
=> nil
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if not true
=> nil
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if !true
=> nil
```

The above examples show how conditionals can be written in both single line (coherent) statements and as conditional blocks. The same applies for `while` and `until`:

```
>> x = x + 1 while x < 10
=> nil
>> x
=> 10
>> x = x - 1 until x == 1
=> nil
>> x
=> 1
>> while x < 10
>>   x = x + 1
>>   puts x
>> end
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
=> nil
```

NOTE: `=` is for assignment; `==` tests for equality.

Other values can be used for conditional tests:

```
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if 1
This appears to be true.
=> nil
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if 'random string'
warning: string literal in condition
This appears to be true.
=> nil
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if 0
This appears to be true.
=> nil
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if true
This appears to be true.
=> nil
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if false
=> nil
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if nil
=> nil
```

NOTE: _Everything_ except for `nil` and `false` evaluates to `true`, _even 0_!

Logical operators `and`, `or`, `&&`, and `||`.

```
>> true and false
=> false
>> true or false
=> true
>> false && false
=> false
>> true && this_will_cause_an_error
Traceback (most recent call last):
        4: from /usr/bin/irb:23:in `<main>'

        1: from (irb):150
NameError (undefined local variable or method `this_will_cause_an_error' for main:Object)
>> true | false
=> true
```

NOTE: Use `&` or `|` to compare while executing the whole expression.

#### Duck Typing

Ruby is _not_ actually strongly type, but "behaves like a strongly typed language most of the time."

```
> 4 + 'four'
Traceback (most recent call last):
        5: from /usr/bin/irb:23:in `<main>'
        4: from /usr/bin/irb:23:in `load'
        3: from /usr/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/irb-1.0.0/exe/irb:11:in `<top (required)>'
        2: from (irb):1
        1: from (irb):1:in `+'
TypeError (String can't be coerced into Integer)
>> 4.class
=> Integer
>> (4.0).class
=> Float
>> 4 + 4.0
=> 8.0
```

The above example shows how you'll get an error when types collide.

NOTE: Ruby does type checking at run time (not compile time). +
"This concept is called _dynamic typing_.

The following example illustrates this point. The type error only occurs when the function is executed (i.e. at run time).


```
>> def add_them_up
>>   4 + 'four'
>> end
=> :add_them_up
>> add_them_up
Traceback (most recent call last):
        6: from /usr/bin/irb:23:in `<main>'
        5: from /usr/bin/irb:23:in `load'
        4: from /usr/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/irb-1.0.0/exe/irb:11:in `<top (required)>'
        3: from (irb):8
        2: from (irb):6:in `add_them_up'
        1: from (irb):6:in `+'
TypeError (String can't be coerced into Integer)
```

Ruby's type system means that "classes don't have to inherit from the same parent to the used in the same way" (a.k.a duck typing).

```
>> i = 0
=> 0
>> a = ['100', 100.0]
=> ["100", 100.0]
>> while i < 2
>>   puts a[i].to_i
>>   i = i + 1
>> end
100
100
=> nil
```

NOTE: "Duck typing doesn't care what the underlying type might be. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. In this case, the `quack` method is `to_i`."

#### Day 1 Self Study

https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.5/[Ruby API docs]

https://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/[Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide]

**Do:**

Print the string "Hello, world."

```
>> puts 'Hello, world.'
Hello, world.
=> nil
```

For the string "Hello, Ruby," find the index of the word "Ruby".

```
>> a = 'Hello, Ruby,'
=> "Hello, Ruby,"
>> a.index("Ruby")
=> 7

>> 'Hello, Ruby,'.index("Ruby")
=> 7
```

Print your name ten times.

```
>> (1..10).each{|n| puts "yogidevbear"}
yogidevbear
yogidevbear
yogidevbear
yogidevbear
yogidevbear
yogidevbear
yogidevbear
yogidevbear
yogidevbear
yogidevbear
=> 1..10
```

Print the string "This is sentence number 1." where the number 1 changes from 1 to 10.

```
>> (1..10).each{|n| puts "This is sentence number #{n}."}
This is sentence number 1.
This is sentence number 2.
This is sentence number 3.
This is sentence number 4.
This is sentence number 5.
This is sentence number 6.
This is sentence number 7.
This is sentence number 8.
This is sentence number 9.
This is sentence number 10.
=> 1..10
```
