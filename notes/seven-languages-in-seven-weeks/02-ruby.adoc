# Seven Languages in Seven Weeks

## Chapter 2. Ruby

Bruce likens programming languages to different characters.

"Like any person, each language took on a distinct personality. Java was like having a rich lawyer as a brother. He was fun when he was younger, but now he's a black hole that sucks away all the joy in a 100-mile radius."

Meet Ruby: "She's sometimes quirky, always beautiful, a little mysterious, and absolutely magical. Think Mary Poppins, the British nanny."

"Matz, Ruby's creator, doesn't worry about the efficiency of the language. He optimizes the efficiency of the _programmers_."

### 2.1 Quick History

Ruby was created in 1993 by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz). Ruby is:

* interpreted
** Ruby code is executed by an interpreter rather than a compiler
* dynamically typed
** types are bound at execution time rather than compile time
** trade off = flexibility vs execution safety
* object-oriented
** supports encapsulation (data and behaviour are packaged together)
** inheritance through classes (object types are  organised in class trees)
** polymorphism (objects can take many forms)
* from a family of so-called scripting languages

Ruby became popular around 2006 with the emergence of the Rails framework.

Ruby's strength is programmers productivity as opposed to execution speed.

### 2.2 Day 1: Finding a Nanny

#### Lightning Tour

Installation:

Arch Linux:

```
yay -S ruby
yay -S ruby-irb
```

Otherwise, go to https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads and follow steps for specific platform.

#### Using Ruby with the Console

NOTE: Type `irb` to start the interactive console.

Ruby has two types of strings. Single quotes are interpreted literally. Double quotes are evaluated.

```
>> language = 'Ruby'
=> "Ruby"
>> puts 'Hello, #{language}'
Hello, #{language}
=> nil
>> puts "Hello, #{language}"
Hello, Ruby
=> nil
```

#### The Programming Model

NOTE: Ruby is a pure object-oriented language.

"Just about everything in Ruby is an object, down to each individual number."

```
>> 4
=> 4
>> 4.class
=> Integer
>> 4 + 4
=> 8
>> 4.methods
=> [:-@, :**, :<=>, :upto, :<<, :<=, :>=, :==, :chr, :===, :>>, :[], :%, :&, :inspect, :*, :+, :ord, :-, :/, :size, :succ, :<, :>, :to_int, :coerce, :to_s, :to_i, :to_f, :divmod, :to_r, :fdiv, :modulo, :remainder, :abs, :magnitude, :integer?, :floor, :ceil, :round, :truncate, :^, :odd?, :even?, :allbits?, :anybits?, :nobits?, :downto, :times, :pred, :pow, :bit_length, :digits, :numerator, :denominator, :rationalize, :gcd, :lcm, :gcdlcm, :next, :div, :|, :~, :imag, :abs2, :+@, :phase, :to_c, :polar, :angle, :conjugate, :conj, :eql?, :singleton_method_added, :i, :real?, :zero?, :nonzero?, :finite?, :infinite?, :step, :positive?, :negative?, :clone, :dup, :arg, :quo, :rectangular, :rect, :real, :imaginary, :between?, :clamp, :instance_variable_defined?, :remove_instance_variable, :instance_of?, :kind_of?, :is_a?, :tap, :instance_variable_set, :protected_methods, :instance_variables, :instance_variable_get, :private_methods, :public_methods, :public_send, :method, :public_method, :singleton_method, :define_singleton_method, :extend, :to_enum, :enum_for, :=~, :!~, :respond_to?, :freeze, :object_id, :send, :display, :nil?, :hash, :class, :singleton_class, :itself, :yield_self, :then, :taint, :tainted?, :untaint, :untrust, :untrusted?, :trust, :frozen?, :methods, :singleton_methods, :equal?, :!, :instance_exec, :!=, :instance_eval, :__id__, :__send__]
```

NOTE: "You can call any method on an object with the dot operator."

```
>> 4.odd?
=> false
>> 4.even?
=> true
>> 4.nonzero?
=> 4
>> 0.nonzero?
=> nil
```

#### Decisions

"[T]he way a language makes decisions is a central concept that shapes the way you code, and think, in a given language. Ruby is like most object-oriented and procedural languages in many ways."

```
>> x = 4
=> 4
>> x < 5
=> true
>> x <= 4
=> true
>> x > 4
=> false
>> false.class
=> FalseClass
>> true.class
=> TrueClass
```

`true` and `false` are also first-class objects.

```
>> puts 'This appears to be false.' unless x == 4
=> nil
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if x == 4
This appears to be true.
=> nil
>> if x == 4
>>   puts 'This appears to be true.'
>> end
This appears to be true.
=> nil
>> unless x == 4
>>   puts 'This appears to be false.'
>> else
>>   puts 'This appears to be true.'
>> end
This appears to be true.
=> nil
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if not true
=> nil
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if !true
=> nil
```

The above examples show how conditionals can be written in both single line (coherent) statements and as conditional blocks. The same applies for `while` and `until`:

```
>> x = x + 1 while x < 10
=> nil
>> x
=> 10
>> x = x - 1 until x == 1
=> nil
>> x
=> 1
>> while x < 10
>>   x = x + 1
>>   puts x
>> end
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
=> nil
```

NOTE: `=` is for assignment; `==` tests for equality.

Other values can be used for conditional tests:

```
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if 1
This appears to be true.
=> nil
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if 'random string'
warning: string literal in condition
This appears to be true.
=> nil
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if 0
This appears to be true.
=> nil
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if true
This appears to be true.
=> nil
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if false
=> nil
>> puts 'This appears to be true.' if nil
=> nil
```

NOTE: _Everything_ except for `nil` and `false` evaluates to `true`, _even 0_!

Logical operators `and`, `or`, `&&`, and `||`.

```
>> true and false
=> false
>> true or false
=> true
>> false && false
=> false
>> true && this_will_cause_an_error
